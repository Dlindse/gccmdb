# Global Climate Change Measures Database

The GCCMDB is a project with the general objective of creating a comprehensive global survey of documented measures—defined here as projects, policies, incentives, and laws undertaken by government and non-govenrmental agencies—to address climate change. 

Specific objectives include:

- Collecting and standardizing data on documented global efforts addressing climate change
- Analyzing and presenting data on global efforts addressing climate change along different axes

In this repository you will find documentation on the data sourcing methodology, transformation, analysis, and presentation.
