Principle of a system of green certificates : 
1. A green certificate is allocated to a producer of green electricity every time its production avoids the emission of a fixed amount of CO2, if it had to be produced in a reference fossil fuel plant (natural gas : combined cycle gas turbine - CCGT). 2. Each year, a predefined (and annually increasing) percentage of electricity supplied to end users has to be covered by green electricity. Suppliers must restitute the necessary number of green certificates to demonstrate that they respect that rule. In case of failure, a penalty fee is due. This situation creates a market for green certificates for the benefit of green electricity producers. In Flanders, a similar process is established for combines heat and power (CHP), while CHP is integrated in the green certificates system in Brussels and Wallonia. Green certificates and CHP certificates : share of electricity sales to be covered by renewable energy systems (RES) and/or high efficiency CHP. Guaranteed minimum income for suppliers of green energy. Shares are regularly updated by regional regulation authorities. Federal authority : (offshore windfarms; see also EP-A05) 1. A green certificate is an immaterial good certifying that a producer produced a given amount of green electricity (ie. produced from renewable energy sources) during a given period of time 
2. There is a legal obligation for the transmission network operator (TSO) to buy all green certificates granted to the holders of a domain concession and originating from offshore wind energy production. The obligation to purchase green electricity certificates produced from offshore wind energy is the subject, on the proposal of the network operator, of a contract between the holder of the domain concession and the network manager. 
3. The final cost of this system is borne by the final consumer through a tariff overload.",,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

Bulgaria,Household and Services: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEASURES IN THE PROGRAMME FOR ACCELERATED GASIFICATION TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION,Single PaM,"Economic, Fiscal",Implemented,ESD,Energy consumption,,,Government,"Government: Ministry of energy,Government: Ministry of environment and water,Government: Energy and water regulatory commission",2013,Yes,Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU ,CO2,"Introduction of institutional and fiscal incentives. Creating a competitive environment for the used energy resources. Introduction and promotion of flexible financial schemes - contracts for sale of energy. Incentives in case of combined and integrated solutions to reduce energy consumption. The Energy Strategy of Bulgaria envisages creation of conditions for access to the gas distribution system to 30% of households in 2020 and substitution of electricity used for heating purposes which would save households more than 1 bln. BGN of energy costs. The use of natural gas instead of electricity for heating and domestic purposes can save about 100 kWh/year at least, and up to 1800 kWh/year per household. 

The evaluation of the potential decrease of emissions was made with the following assumptions: a household with 3 members, an apartment with 70 m2 of heated area, without energy saving measures, using electricity for heating and household needs. The average annual consumption of energy for heating is about 11 188 kWh. In view of the delayed implementation of policies in this area a conservative scenario with 15% gasified domestic needs was considered when assessing this measure. An emission factor was adopted with regard to electric energy as in the National Programme for Renovation of Residential Buildings in the Republic of Bulgaria. In the absence of reliable data and projections a scenario of even development was used for a period of 7 years until the total percentage rate of gasified households is reached in 2020. The analysis assumes that 430 050 households will be gasified by 2020. The effect of fuel substitution and the use of natural gas can be divided into direct effect – related to the efficiency of transformation, and additional effect – related to an environmentally cleaner fuel. The direct impact is related to immediate reduction of fuel and energy consumption, with the assumption that the energy consumption is reduced by 15% (pessimistic scenario) over the entire assessed period. It is assumed in this case that the old inefficient equipment (with higher coefficient of energy transformation) will be replaced by new one, while the different calorific value of fuels is not taken into account. In this case the substitution of the fuel base will lead to direct fuel and energy savings of 721.7GWh or 492.9ktCO2.

The indirect effect is estimated at about 1983.4ktCO2. 65 The total amount of reduced emissions will be 2476.4 ktCO2.
With the achievement of the 30% target set in the Strategy, the minimum savings of households will be 1443.5 GWh – direct savings resulting from the improvement of transformation efficiency, or 985.9ktCO2. In addition, the effect on the reduction of GHG emission will be a result of the use of an environmentally cleaner fuel and the total cumulative effect will be 4952.8 ktCO2. Main instrument for implementation of the measure is the introduction of institutional and fiscal incentives aimed at increasing the share of households using natural gas: creation of a competitive environment with respect to the used energy resources; introduction and promotion of flexible financial plans – contracts for sale of energy; incentives for combined and integrated solutions to reduce the energy consumption. In case of 30% gasification in 2020 , the investments of households for switching to natural gas are estimated at approximately 5000 BGN (between 1800 and 7000 BGN depending on the technological solutions) - according to a study carried out by the Strategic Consultant of the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism, selected at the end of 2011 under International Fund Kozloduy. The analysis is based on information provided by gas distribution companies and covers the households on the territory of Bulgaria that use natural gas for heating purposes. The required investments are estimated at 774 mln. BGN as a minimum, depending on the technological solutions. The implementation of this measure will have long-term effect on the amount of GHG emissions also after 2020. It is expected that at least 2476.4 kt CO2 will be reduced cumulatively by 2020.",2020,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

(proportional) annual reduction of the amount of energy provided on the market by distribution companies and traders in energy
(end-use consumption). Market mechanisms and incentives to reduce fuel and energy consumption need to be established along
with mandatory schemes and market of energy services (market of “white” certificates/ certificates of energy savings).
The measure is consistent with the policy proposed by the EC to improve the energy efficiency in end-use consumption by
saving annually fuel and energy equivalent to 1.5% of the energy provided by distribution companies and traders in energy on
the market for the previous year (excluding energy in transport). The annual energy savings, respectively obligations, will be
constant value (expressed in percentage) until 2020. To introduce such a scheme it is necessary to undertake appropriate
legislative changes and to prepare its structure and operation. The responsible persons will be determined in the course of
development of the scheme.
These can be both traders in fuel and energy or end consumers. The actual reduction of fuel and energy consumption occurs in
end-use consumption and should be a result of implemented measures.
The anticipated effect is determined on the basis of projected fuel and energy consumption in the Industry and Household sectors
where the consumption is expected to decrease by 1,5% on an annual basis. The decrease in final fuel and energy consumption
according to the objectives will lead to reduction of emissions as follows: 40.5ktCO2eq. (by 2016); 41.4 ktCO2eq. (by 2020).",2020,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

It gradually reduces the amount of nutrients and the humus in soil. Erosion aggravates the structure, as well as the water and air regime of soil. The combination of the specific natural and economic conditions in Bulgaria is a reason for the high risk of degradation processes in agricultural soils. The most common processes of soil degradation include water and wind erosion, pollution, reduction of organic matter stocks (humus), compaction, acidification, salinisation, loss of biodiversity. More than 60% of the country is affected by varying degrees of erosion. 11.8 % of the country’s territory is severely eroded. 65% of agricultural land is threatened by water erosion and 24% is threatened by wind erosion. The average annual intensity of soil erosion varies according to land use, but soil loss in agricultural lands is estimated at 12.256 tonnes/ha a year on average. The water erosion of soil controls the stocks of organic carbon and their distribution on the landscape which affects the circulation of carbon, the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the global warming.

As of 1 January 2011 a tax on methane emissions - equal in terms of CO2 equivalents to the CO2 tax - from natural gas fired power plants was introduced. This is expected to reduce methane emissions from gas engines through behavioural changes such as changing from motor operation to boiler operation and establishing mitigation measures. Consumption is also expected to fall as the price of heat will increase. These behavioural changes will result in falls in the emissions of unburned methane from power stations. In addition, CO2 emissions will fall and consumption of natural gas will fall.

The EU Member States have devised this trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions in order to fulfil the international climate commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in particular with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions from energy production and energy-intensive industries.
The allowances scheme entered into force on 1 January 2005. The 2005-2007 period was used as a testing phase. The EU ETS Directive has been revised a number of times.
The allowance allocation for 2008-2012 was determined on the basis of the national allocation plan from July 2006, submitted the European Commission. The EU ETS 2008-2012 has been an important measure in Denmark's fulfilment of its climate obligations under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The scheme aligns well with government policy for the energy area on liberalisation of the energy markets and management of environment efforts by the market.
The installations subject to the allowance regulations account for a little less than half of Danish emissions of greenhouse gases. Almost all major Danish installations with considerable emissions are covered by the ETS. Most of these are generators of power and heat, the rest are industrial enterprises plus a few production units within the offshore sector.
Both the statutory and the administrative basis for the scheme have been established. The necessary legal basis was adopted by the Danish Folketing in June 2004 and the 2008-2012 national allocation plan was approved by the European Commission on 31 August 2007.
According to the national allocation plan for the period 2008-2012 an average annual allowance of 24.5 million tonnes CO2 has been allocated. According to the allocation plan this should correspond to a drop in annual emissions of about 5 million tonnes per year in 2008-2012, or a reduction of about 17% compared with emissions expected in the national allocation plan for the period. This level was set by balancing environmental considerations against competitiveness and jobs:

•	Electricity and heat producers were allocated about 15.8 million EAUs. The allowance for electricity generation is allocated as ”per kWh”, while for heat production allowances are allocated according to emissions in the base years 1998-2004. 

•	The other 133 installations (industry and offshore) have been allocated allowances corresponding to emissions in the base years 1998-2004. A total of 8.2 million tonnes CO2 per year have been allocated to industry and offshore. 

•	A special reserve of 0.5 million tonnes CO2 per year has been allocated with free allowances for new installations and significant extensions to existing units.

Allowances not allocated by the end of the commitment period or returned due to closures have been auctioned. The period 2008 – 2012 was finalized in 2013 with the final surrendering of allowances and credits by companies participating in the EU ETS as shown in section 4.3.1.
The new EU Climate and Energy Agreement from December 2008 extended the ETS system to 2013-2020 in order for the EU to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% in 2020. At the same time allocation was centralised and auctioning is to be used more extensively from 2013. The allowances have been calculated for this period in accordance with the EU benchmarking decision 2011/278/EU. Annex 1f contains an overview of the installations and aviation operators covered and their allowance allocation for 2013-2020.
However, the current low allowances price has made it more difficult to initiate the necessary transition and green investments after 2012.
Developments in allowances prices have particular significance for Danish emissions and they affect the need to initiate other, new mitigation initiatives. The low allowances price makes the situation relatively more expensive for countries like Denmark, who want to take the lead. Therefore, efforts to increase the level of ambition in EU climate policy are key in the Danish government’s climate change policy to achieve the national target.",,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,
Denmark,EN-2: Biomass Agreement (Agreement on the use of biomass in electricity production),Single PaM,"Economic, Voluntary",Implemented,No information,Energy supply,,,Government,Government: The electricity producers,1993,No,No information,CO2,"In 2015, biomass accounted for approximately 62% of renewable-energy production, mostly in the form of straw, wood pellets, wood chip and biodegradable waste for incineration. Approximately half of the biomass was imported, mainly in the form of wood pellets (32 PJ), biofuels (7 PJ), wood chips (6 PJ) and fire wood (3 PJ).
The energy production from biomass has more than doubled since 1990 - primarily due to the policy agreement from 1993 (the Biomass Agreement: requires power plants to use 1.4 million tonnes of straw and wood, equivalent to almost 20 PJ per year) and the policy agreement from February 2008 on the increased use of straw and chips at the large co-generation plants (up to 700,000 tonnes in 2011). At the same time, the consumption of biomass continues to rise as a source of energy for the supply of heat in district-heating plants and in smaller installations for households, enterprises and institutions.
Although it was demonstrated in Denmark in the mid-1990s that biogas plants can be established with reliable operation and with an acceptable economy biogas still only accounted for 3.3% of renewable-energy production in 2013. 
Liquid biofuels, such as animal and vegetable oils, biodiesel and bioethanol, is used only on a small scale. Liquid biofuels from bio-waste by the so-called second generation technologies are now at a low level.",,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

A long list of direct and indirect support schemes and policies have, in combination, created a domestic market which has given Danish companies a boost. This boost has enabled many companies to become international market leaders. Danish companies continue to enjoy commercial success within the energy-related marketplace. R&D activities include energy savings, more efficient energy conversion and renewable energy technologies. Research and development activities in the field of energy are not motivated solely by climate issues, but are relevant to climate issues, since they contribute to determining the overall framework for the CO2 intensity of energy production and consumption in the future. 
There is a broad political commitment to support R&D activities through public funding and the Danish Government has in its manifesto by November 2016 stated that Denmark is committed to an ambitious green transition for the national energy supply. This calls for comprehensive R&D efforts for the development of improved and new sustainable energy technologies.
Denmark is one of the partners in Mission Innovation comprising 22 countries and the European Commission. The aim of Mission Innovation is to strengthen the multilateral R&D efforts within clean energy technologies to promote a continuous cost effective green transition of the energy systems. 
Thus Denmark has chosen to strengthen the dedicated public investments in clean energy research, development and demonstration focusing on reduction of technology costs and CO2 emissions and with an emphasis on innovative projects that can be replicated and scaled up with the involvement of private investors. Denmark will seek to double these efforts departing from a baseline of the average funding to the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme (EUDP) of the years 2015-2016 and until 2020 where DKK 580 million will be allocated. 
The EUDP programme was established in 2008 and since then the programme has supported more than 600 projects with a total of DDK 3 billion. On average, 45-50% of the activities under the Programme are financed by the EUDP and hence the private investments in the supported projects are of the same size as the public support leading to approximately to DKK 6 billion in total investments.
A minor programme is administrated on behalf of the power distribution companies by the Danish power association Dansk Energi. The objective is to support research and development within energy-efficient use of electricity through development of energy-efficient products and processes in buildings, industry etc. The annual funds for this programme are DKK 25 million.
Activities relating to strategic research and innovation in general are since 2014 administrated by Danish Innovation Fond.  The Fund’s budget for 2017 is 1.25 billion. The Fund covers all sorts of research and innovation projects and is not limited to energy matters.",,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

Land use planning creates the preconditions for a sound and vital residential and living environment and support the regional availability of services and traffic. Finland’s land use planning system, as defined in the law, gives municipalities a high degree of autonomy in local land use planning. Community structure development is controlled with land use planning and building permission schemes.
A local detailed plan lays out the organization of land use and building within the municipality and directs land use and building according to the requirements set by local conditions, the townscape and the landscape, good building practices and other agreed objectives.

Elle impose des mesures très concrètes pour atteindre ces objectifs. Toute construction de certains types de bâtiments équipés d’un parc de stationnement (habitation, tertiaire, industriel, accueillant un service public, constituant un ensemble commercial, cinéma), doit doter une partie de ces places de stationnement de « gaines techniques, câblages et dispositifs de sécurité nécessaires à l’alimentation d’une prise de recharge pour véhicule électrique ou hybride rechargeable ». Il en va de même lorsque sont réalisés des « travaux sur un parc de stationnement annexe » à ces mêmes types de bâtiments.
Par ailleurs l’installation de bornes de recharges bénéficie de soutiens financiers.
- Pour les particuliers l’installation de bornes de recharge pour les voitures est éligible au crédit d’impôt pour la transition énergétique à hauteur de 30% des dépenses engagées (mesure reconduite pour 2017).
- Les projets d’installation de bornes de recharges publiques par les collectivités locales ont bénéficié de subventions, grâce au fonds du Programme d’Investissements d’Avenir. 77 projets ont été subventionnés pour 61 M€ d'aide et 22 300 points de charge.
- Le programme ADVENIR (Aide au Développement des Véhicules Électriques vis de Nouvelles Infrastructures de Recharge) a été lancé en février 2016. Le programme ADVENIR est porté par l'Avere France, association nationale regroupant les acteurs de la mobilité électrique, et EcoCO2, entreprise spécialisée dans la maîtrise de l'énergie et la sensibilisation des consommateurs. Il a été officialisé le 10 février 2016 lors de la signature de la convention par les différentes parties prenantes : l'État, l'Avere France, Eco CO2, l'ADEME et EDF. Le programme a pour objectif de permettre l'installation de 12 000 points de recharge privés pour véhicules électriques et hybrides rechargeables d’ici fin 2018. Ce programme subventionne les points de recharge installés dans des parkings d'entreprise ou de personnes publiques accessibles aux salariés et aux flottes d’entreprises, les points de recharge accessibles au public installés sur des espaces privés (parkings de bâtiments commerciaux, services publics, parking en ouvrage…) ainsi que les points de recharge installés en habitat collectif, individuels ou collectifs, via les particuliers, les bailleurs sociaux, les syndics ou les propriétaires privés.
- Le décret IRVE relatif aux infrastructures de recharge (12 janvier 2017) vise par ailleurs à uniformiser dans un texte unique l'ensemble des dispositions relatives aux infrastructures de recharge pour véhicules électrique et intègre diverses mesures réglementaires issues de la directive 2014/94/UE.

The implementation of Greek RES Roadmap is based on a sound legislative framework, the core of which is the law 3851/2010 (OG A/85/4th June 2010) on “Accelerating the development of Renewable Energy Sources to deal with climate change and other regulations in topics under the authority of the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change”, along with the recent Law 4254/2014.

The legislative framework aims to accelerate the permitting procedure of the larger projects as much as possible, simplifies considerably the licensing of smaller projects, offers new attractive feed-in-tariffs for all RES technologies,  introduces new clauses for offshore wind, deals with the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) phenomenon at several levels and establishes an Autonomous RES Office to act as a One-Stop-Shop for RES-Electricity. Law 3833/2010 specifies which renewable energy sources (wind, solar, tidal power etc.) are exempted from excise duties, when they are used for the generation of electricity for private purposes only.

(Α) Interventions in the transport system
Public works to enhance the existing infrastructure described in the previous National Communications (road-grid improvements in the large urban centres, reconstruction of major highways, improvements in the traffic-light system) are in progress.
Programmes for the upgrading of the traffic lights system (road signaling), as well as the overall traffic management and control have been developed since 2002 in Athens. Therefore, half of the traffic lights in the region of Athens (roughly 1500) are in cooperation, while the Center of Traffic Management, which belongs to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and collects traffic information from 842 traffic nodes in a daily base. According to collected information, processes for the improvement of the road signaling have been established. 

(Β) Interventions in public transport
Important interventions have already been implemented or are under development aiming at the enforcement of public transport. In Athens, the two new metro lines, which were completed and started operation in 2000, are being expanded, while new metro lines are in the implementation phase. In Thessaloniki a new metro line is under construction. The operation of suburban railway in the wider area of Athens has already started, the connection to Corinthos and Chalkida was completed, while the connection with Livadia is expected to operate in the near future. Also in 2004, a new tram started operating in Athens with 2 lines reaching from the center of the city to the southern waterfront suburbs.
Concerning rail transport, since 2000, more than 250 km of new rail lines have been constructed (including replacement of old single lines), while more than 220 km rail lines have been converted to electrical driven. Besides, more than 300 km of new rail lines are under construction phase.     
An extended network of bus lanes of approximately 50 km length has already been created, resulting in the increase of the average speed of buses in Athens from 16 km/h to 23 km/h. The fleet of buses has been renewed to a large extent, while approximately 600 buses approximately use natural gas as fuel and 100 buses operate with engines of Euro V technology. Moreover the renewal of the fleet of electrically driven buses (trolleys) began in 1998 with the supply of 224 vehicles and was extended with the supply of additional 142 vehicles by the end of 2004. 
In addition, by Law 2963/2001 (A 268), an age limit of 23 years has been instituted for all urban, semi-urban and long distance buses. Also the limit of 11 years was set as the higher permissible age for buses in public transport. Under the provisions of the same law, economic incentives were given in the owners for the replacement of vehicles with new or used vehicles of small age. Of the 5000 semi-urban and long distance buses licensed in Greece, 1846 buses have been replaced since 2004, of which 1746 with  new and 100 with used  of age lower than 5 years. Moreover, the replacement of tourist coaches was encouraged by subsidies provided for in Article 31 of Law 3229/2004. By Article 7 of Law 2446/96, an age limit of 23 years has been also instituted for them. The replacement program was supervised by the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism. 
Finally, the public transport system in Athens is being reorganized on the basis of the new metro and tram lines, with buses and trolleys also playing a complementary role of connecting the metro and tram stations with other areas of the city.

(C) Interventions in vehicles
The main regulation that aims at the restriction of GHG emissions from vehicles is the one requiring regular technical checks of vehicles, which has been mandatory since 1983 and takes place at the Centers for Technical Control of Vehicles (CTCV). The law provides for the establishment of private Centers for Technical Control, the improvement of public ones and the development of a special organization to supervise the operation of the above-mentioned Centers. Currently, according to data of the Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks, 56 public and 37 private centers operate and other 40 have been licensed and start or expected to start operation in the coming period. With the increase of the CTCV number during the next period, the essential conditions and infrastructures for an important increase of the number of checked vehicles per year are created, in accordance with the objectives of the National Program.
An equally important intervention for GHG emissions reduction from vehicles is the exhaust control card, which is required for all vehicles and should be renewed on an annual basis for private passenger cars and trucks up to 3.5 t. Certified auto-repair shops expressly certified to carry out this task and issue the control card.
Moreover, under the framework of the implementation of policies for the replacement of old vehicles, a list of actions has been taken place. The buses fleet is being renewed, aiming to the improvement of energy efficiency of vehicles. 
According to the Law 3109/2003 the age limits for the public use cars (taxi) were revised and economic incentives were given to the taxi - owners for the replacement of their vehicles with new ones (9300 taxis have been replaced). 
The establishment of a renewal program for the fleet of motorcycles, with incentives for the final withdrawal of two-wheeled motorcycles over 50 c.c. and aged more than ten years (categorized until 1994 for motorcycles and 1996 for motorbikes) is another important intervention in the transport sector. The program was put in force with Law 3245/2004 – article 2 (A 110) and its force was extended by Law 3333/2005 (A 91). Incentives for the replacement of passenger cars and promotion of energy efficient vehicles (natural gas, biofuels, hybrid cars) are under implementation or under planning phase. 
The voluntary agreement between the European Commission and the European, Japanese and Korean car-manufacturers associations to improve the fuel efficiency of new cars is considered as an adopted measure aiming at the reduction of GHG emissions in conjunction with promotion of ecologic labeling – energy labeling of passenger cars. The agreement foresees the improvement of the fuel efficiency of new cars, so as the CO2 emission factor to reach down to 140gr/km in 2008. The measure is expected to have an important long-term output through the penetration of low emissions vehicles in the total fleet. The mandatory quota with energy efficient vehicles in public services or organizations and the linking of vehicle tax with energy efficiency and CO2 emissions were also adopted. 
Finally, the development of urban mobility plans and the promotion of eco-driving, interventions for the safe movement of bicycles in the cities and the construction of new bicycle paths are measures that is expected to contribute to GHG emissions reduction. 

(D) New planned measures for addressing air pollution from road traffic in urban centers.
In July 2009, the former Ministry for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works (present Ministry of Environment and Energy) introduced a package of measures for addressing air pollution from road traffic. These measures concerned the calculation of Environmental motor vehicle circulation fee (road tax), incentives for fleet renewal and removal of vehicles as well as a proposal for a “Green” traffic ring. These measures were applied only for a few months in 2009 and they were cancelled. In their place new measures were applied. More specifically, new circulation taxes were decided to be applied from November 2010 for all new vehicles according their CO2 emissions. This measure obviously aims at promoting new technology vehicles of low CO2 emissions. Additionally, a new withdrawal system for old passenger cars with financial incentives was set in early 2011 but with poor results because of the economic crisis. This measure was applicable until the mid of 2016. Finally, the green ring was adopted in 2012 concerning traffic restriction measures for the older technology cars in the center of Athens.",,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

Greece,Measures in the LULUCF sector,Single PaM,"Economic, Education, Information, Planning, Regulatory",Implemented,LULUCF,"Land use, land use change and forestry",,,Government,Government: Ministry of Environment and Energy,2000,Yes,LULUCF Decision No 529/2013/EU ,CO2,"The targets of the Greek policy regarding the “Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry” sector are the conservation and the protection of existing forest land, its gradual increase, as well as the improvement of the degraded forest lands. The sustainable management of the forest land was early legislated (Presidential Decree 19-11-1928) while the sustainability of the significant multi-functioning role of forests (e.g. erosion protection, regulation of the water budget, conservation of biodiversity) has been ensured through the directive 958/1953.

The measures for the LULUCF sector are arisen from rural development actions and other financial mechanisms. In the overall Greek fiscal deficiency the policies already implemented and measures taken, and those that are expected to be adopted according to the Rural Development Program “Alexandros Mpaltatzis” (concerning the forth programming period 2007-2013) aim for the above mentioned targets achievement, contribute to the mitigation of the climate change, and could be divided into the following broad categories:

1.	Forest protection
        a. A large number of activities take place every year in the context of the forest fires prevention policy. The fuel management and the vegetation treatment at the most vulnerable forest areas, the conservation of the existing mountainous road network and the development of new roads where necessary, the regular patrolling during the fire season, and the public awareness campaigns are the main preventative measures against forest fires.
        b. Furthermore, the Greek Ministry of Environment and Energy (MEEN) elaborates policy measures in the context of the acceleration and simplification of the national Forest Map project under the national Cadastre Survey. The development of Forest Maps involves the delineation and recording of forest lands that fall under the protective provisions of Greek forest legislation in an accurate, transparent and definitive way. With the completion of the current Forest Map project the 62.5% of the total estimated forest area is expected to be recorded, while the procurement for the rest area is due in 2013. 
2.	Forest management
       a. One of the main responsibilities of the Greek Forest Services is the forest management through the development and implementation of the Forest Management Plans. For that purposes, financial and human resources are allocated in order either to update the Forest Management Plans that have been expired or to develop new ones. The public forest wood production (timber, industrial and fuelwood) in 2010  was approximately 738,806.00 m3, while the wood production from private forests (approximately 36% of the total forest land) was approximately 309,156.00 m3. 
       b. Additionally, in some regions the treatment of the forests for resin production purposes is being implemented with a significant economic, social and ecological (preventative) value.
3.	Restoration – increase of forest lands
The rehabilitation of burnt and degraded (flood and erosion protection) forest lands has always been a main part in the Forest Service’s agenda. During 2010 the public nurseries in operation numbered 33 in which 4,928,686.00 of plants of different forest species (evergreen, deciduous) were produced. The area reforested in 2008, 2009, and 2010, as well as the amount of money spent on those projects were 1,118.00 ha, 1,124.00 ha, 0.531 ha, and 2,195,000.00€, 1,879,200.00€, and 808,500.00€, respectively.
4.	Adaptation of forest management to climate change
In January 2010, the Life+ project entitled AdaptFor “Adaptation of Forest Management to climate change in Greece” was launched, which is implemented by the Goulandris Natural History Museum / Greek Biotope - Wetland Centre in cooperation with the General Directorate for the Development and Protection of Forests and Natural Environment (MEEN), and is expected to be completed in June 2013. The project’s objectives are: the demonstration of the approach of adapting forest management to climate change, the enhancement of the capacity of forest services to adapt forest management to climate change, and the dissemination of the need for adaptation of forest management to climate change to other stakeholders and to the general public.
5.	Other projects
A couple more projects that have already been launched under the Rural Development Program “Alexandros Mpaltatzis” (2007-2013) are “The improvement of the employment in the framework of forest fire prevention and the restoration of forest areas affected by forest fires”, and “The opening and conservation of the road network into the forests under forest management”",,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

The Directive imposes a legal obligation on Member States to achieve new savings each year from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 of 1.5% of the annual energy sales to final customers of all energy distributors and all retail energy sales companies by volume, averaged over the most recent three-year period prior to 1 January 2013. The target is cumulative, which means that it is based on incremental annual savings that deliver a total volume of savings at the end of the obligation period in 2020.

Ireland has chosen to effect the provisions of Article 7(9) of the Directive, opting to combine alternative policy measures and an energy efficiency obligation scheme to meet the national target. Obligated parties under the EEOS are energy distributors and retail energy sales companies that have market sales in Ireland of greater than 600 GWh final sales in any relevant year, regardless of the sector they supply.

Obligated parties’ targets are allocated according to their proportion of energy market sales volume in Ireland. Member States are obliged to put in place measurement, control and verification systems to verify savings by obligated parties. The positions against targets for each year are to be achieved, audited and finalised by 31 March of the following year. The target allocated to obligated parties is 550 GWh PPE for the period 2014 to 2016, 625GWh PPE for 2017 and 700GWh PPE from 2018 to 2020. This is sub-sectoralised as 75% non-residential, 20% residential and 5% energy poverty residential. The minimum achievement for the period 2014-2016 is Year 1 60%, Year 2 75% cumulative and Year 3 90% cumulative. From Year 4 onwards, the minimum cumulative achievement will be 95% cumulative.

Obligated parties can choose to achieve energy savings independently or through partnerships with service providers in the market. The scheme permits the exchange of validated savings between obligated parties in certain circumstances. Obligated parties can buyout up to a maximum of 30% of their total cumulative target, whether or not they have achieved their minimum cumulative target. For any portion of the minimum annual target not achieved, exchanged or bought out, a penalty will be imposed. The price of buyout and penalty will be set and published by the Minister and reviewed as appropriate.

In the Residential and Energy Poverty sectors energy savings from energy conservation measures are calculated using deemed credits per measure based on Building Ratings under EPBD
In the Non-Residential sector scaled or measured savings based on ISO 50015, IPMVP or equivalent are used to calculate savings. Project data is uploaded to SEAI bespoke systems and is subject to Evaluation and Audit.",2020,http://www.seai.ie/eeos/,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this policy is to boost energy savings by putting an incentive on reducing the consumption of gas and electricity, which should direct consumers toward more energy efficient behaviour. The Regulatory Energy Tax (REB) was introduced in 1996, changing its name to Energy Tax in 2004. Taxing energy use makes energy saving (by changing behaviour or investing in energy-saving measures) more attractive. The energy tax is levied on electricity and natural gas, and the level of the Energy Tax depends on 1) the energy consumption of a customer – the higher the consumption, the lower the energy tax levied (degressive tariff structure) –, and 2) specific agreements between different sectors and the government.
For small (residential) consumers the Energy Tax accounted for approximately ~40% of the natural gas and ~30% of electricity price in 2012. Industrial consumers pay a much lower tariff because of their larger consumption. In addition, there is a specific clause in the Environmental Taxes Act (Article 36q), which exempts companies that enter into a Long Term Agreement with the government from paying energy taxes on electricity consumption that goes over 10 million kWh per year and from taxes on fuel for non-energy use (feedstocks). The Energy Tax also has a separate lower gas tariff for the horticulture sector (fixed up to 2013). This means that these companies are taxed in the same way as the energy-intensive large-scale consumers. In return, the sector has entered into voluntary agreements on energy efficiency with the government.",,,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aims of this Covenant are:
• CO2 emissions: a reduction of 3.5 to 4.5 Mt in 2020 compared to 1990.
• Other greenhouse gases: reduction of 4.0 to 6.0 Mt CO2 equivalents in 2020 compared to 1990.
• Energy saving: an average annual energy efficiency improvement of 2% over the period 2011-2020.
• Approximately 150 PJ of sustainable energy in 2020, including approximately 12 PJ of wind energy.
The sector is expected to take cost-effective measures that contribute to emission reductions of greenhouse gases on a voluntary basis. There are three categories of measures that can contribute to reducing emissions: developing Best Management Practices for reducing N2O emissions (emissions are reduced by reducing nitrogen flows on farms), taking measures related to cattle feed to reduce CH4 emissions (the composition of feed can affect the production of methane via the cattle’s digestive systems. In general: the better the digestibility, the lower the methane emissions) and taking measures concerning manure storage to reduce emissions of CH4. Manure fermentation is the main option for reducing methane emissions from manure. An important legislation for restricting the amount of CH4 emissions is found in the (EU) milk quota, which limits the number of dairy herds held in the NL. The number of dairy herds in NL is still uncertain after 2015 when the milk quota system will have ended. From 2013 onwards, new environmental policies on manure use will apply. They will have a significant (positive) effect on the climate, as they promise to increase CH4 production for renewable energy.",2020,http://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/duurzaam-ondernemen/groene-economie/agrosectoren,eea,,,,,,,,,,,

Industry and Government are  taking a range of actions to reduce freight emissions, including the Freight Transport Association's Logistics Carbon Reduction Scheme, which encourages members to record, report and reduce emissions from freight.

The Mode Shift Revenue Support scheme encourages modal shift from road to rail or inland waterway where the costs are higher than road, and where there are environmental benefits to be gained. It currently helps to remove around 800,000 lorry journeys a year from Britain's roads. A similar scheme, Waterborne Freight Grant, can provide assistance with the operating costs associated with coastal or short sea shipping. 

The Government has implemented measures to encourage cleaner and more fuel efficient Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) including through reduced fuel duty rates for road fuel gases, and increasing rewards for renewable gaseous fuels under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. We have recently consulted  on proposed legislative amendments which would further increase support for renewable transport fuels suitable for heavy goods vehicles. 

The Government has helped operators establish and run fleets of alternatively fuelled HGVs through the Low Carbon Truck Trial. £11.3m funding has been provided, via competition, to part fund and test around 370 commercial vehicles, with most using a gas or dual fuel system (diesel and gas), and to develop refuelling infrastructure.
